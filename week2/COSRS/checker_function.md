Absolutely Ali — let’s break down the **Checker functionality** from the ground up. Whether you're dealing with workflows, approvals, or security-critical systems, understanding the **Maker-Checker model** (also called  **4-Eyes principle** ) is essential.

---

## 🧠 What Is Checker Functionality?

The **Checker** is part of a **dual-control system** where tasks are split between two roles:

* **Maker** : Initiates or drafts a task (e.g., creates a transaction, writes a document, configures a campaign).
* **Checker** : Reviews, validates, and approves the task before it’s finalized or executed.

> Think of it as a built-in quality control layer — the Checker ensures nothing goes live without a second set of eyes.

## 🔁 How It Works

### Typical Workflow:

1. **Maker creates** a task (e.g., financial transaction, email campaign, data entry).
2. The task is  **submitted for review** .
3. **Checker receives a notification** and reviews the task.
4. Checker can:
   * ✅ Approve it → task proceeds
   * ❌ Reject it → Maker gets feedback and revises

## 🛠 Where Is It Used?

### 🔐 Security & Compliance

* **Banking & Finance** : Approving high-value transactions or account changes.
* **Insurance & Healthcare** : Validating claims or sensitive data entries.
* **Legal & Regulatory** : Reviewing contracts, disclosures, or filings.

### 📊 Enterprise Workflows

* **Marketing Platforms** : Approving email/SMS campaigns before sending.
* **Procurement Systems** : Validating purchase orders or vendor onboarding.
* **HR Systems** : Reviewing employee data changes or payroll actions.

### 💻 Software Development

* **Code Review** : Maker writes code, Checker reviews for bugs/security.
* **DevOps** : Maker configures deployment, Checker approves release.
