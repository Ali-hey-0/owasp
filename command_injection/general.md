Sure — let’s break it down clearly and in OWASP terms.

## 🛠 What is Command Injection?

**Command Injection** (also called **OS Command Injection** ) is a security vulnerability where an application takes **untrusted user input** and passes it directly into a **system-level command** without proper validation or sanitization.

- Instead of just doing what the developer intended, the attacker can **alter the command** or **append new commands** .
- This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server — with the same privileges as the vulnerable application.

Think of it like giving someone a shopping list, but they can secretly add “buy explosives” at the end — and you still follow it without checking.

## 🔍 How It Happens (OWASP Perspective)

According to OWASP, this usually occurs when:

- **User input** is concatenated into a shell command string.
- The application uses functions like `system()`, `exec()`, `popen()`, or backticks in PHP, Python, Java, etc.
- No **input validation** or **escaping** is applied.

  **Example (PHP)** :

```php
<?php
$filename = $_GET['file'];
system("cat " . $filename);
?>
```

If a user sends:

```
file=test.txt; rm -rf /
```

The server will run both `cat test.txt` **and** `rm -rf /` — which could delete everything.

## 🎯 Risks & Impact

- **Data theft** (reading sensitive files)
- **Data destruction** (deleting or overwriting files)
- **Privilege escalation** (if the process runs as root/admin)
- **Full server compromise**

## 🧪 Testing for Command Injection (OWASP WSTG-INPV-12)

Common test payloads:

- `; ls` (Linux) or `& dir` (Windows)
- `| whoami`
- Time-based tests for **blind injection** :
  - `; ping -c 10 127.0.0.1` (Linux)
  - `& ping -n 10 127.0.0.1` (Windows)

If the output changes or the server delays, it’s a sign of vulnerability.

## 🛡 Prevention (OWASP Cheat Sheet)

1. **Avoid OS commands entirely** — use safe APIs or built-in functions.
   - Example: use `mkdir()` instead of `system("mkdir ...")`.
2. **Allowlist input** — only accept known safe values.
3. **Parameterize commands** — separate data from the command logic.
4. **Escape special characters** — if you must pass input to a shell.
5. **Run with least privilege** — so even if exploited, damage is limited.

✅ **In short:**

Command Injection is like leaving a microphone open to your server’s operating system — OWASP stresses that the safest fix is **never to let user input talk directly to the OS** .

If you want, I can also give you a **visual attack flow diagram** showing how command injection works from input to exploitation. Would you like me to prepare that?
