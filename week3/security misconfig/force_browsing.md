Absolutely Ali — let’s break down **Force Browsing** completely. This is a classic web application attack technique that targets  **access control weaknesses** , and it’s often used to discover and access **restricted resources** by manipulating URLs directly.

## 🧠 What Is Force Browsing?

**Force Browsing** (also called **Forced Browsing** or  **Insecure Direct Object Access** ) is a technique where an attacker manually tries to access **hidden or unauthorized pages, files, or functionalities** by guessing or crafting URLs — without going through the intended navigation or authorization flow.

> Think of it as walking into a room by guessing the door’s location, even though you weren’t given the key.

## 🔍 Why It Happens

Force browsing is possible when:

* Access control is enforced only at the UI level (e.g., buttons or menus are hidden).
* Backend endpoints are exposed but not protected.
* URLs are predictable or sequential.
* Authorization checks are missing or improperly implemented.

## 🧪 Real-World Examples

### 1️⃣ Accessing Admin Pages

```plaintext
https://site.com/admin/dashboard
```

* Regular users don’t see this link, but it’s accessible if typed directly.

### 2️⃣ Downloading Sensitive Files

```plaintext
https://site.com/files/report.pdf
https://site.com/files/confidential.pdf
```

* No authentication required — attacker downloads by guessing filenames.

### 3️⃣ Viewing Other Users’ Data

```plaintext
https://site.com/profile?id=123
→ Change to:
https://site.com/profile?id=124
```

* Attacker views another user’s profile.

### 4️⃣ Accessing Unpublished Content

```plaintext
https://site.com/blog/draft-article
```

* Draft content is accessible before publication.

---

## 🧨 What Attackers Do

* Use automated tools like:
  * **Burp Suite Intruder**
  * **DirBuster**
  * **FFUF**
  * **Gobuster**
* Crawl the site for hidden endpoints.
* Try common paths:
  ```
  /admin
  /config
  /backup
  /logs
  /test
  /dev
  /private
  ```
* Modify parameters to access other users’ data.

---

## 🔐 How to Prevent Force Browsing

### ✅ 1. Enforce Server-Side Access Control

* Never rely on hiding links or buttons.
* Validate user roles and permissions on every request.

### ✅ 2. Use Indirect Object References

* Replace predictable IDs with random tokens or UUIDs:
  ```
  /profile?id=abc123xyz
  ```

### ✅ 3. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

* Define clear roles and restrict access accordingly.

### ✅ 4. Monitor and Log Access Attempts

* Alert on unusual access patterns or brute-force attempts.

### ✅ 5. Use Security Testing Tools

* Scan for exposed endpoints using OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or Nikto.

## ✅ Final Summary

| Risk                 | Description                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Unauthorized access  | Users reach pages they shouldn’t  |
| Data leakage         | Sensitive files or records exposed |
| Privilege escalation | Regular users act as admins        |
| Business logic abuse | Bypass workflows or restrictions   |

> Force browsing is about **guessing what’s behind the curtain** — and if the server doesn’t check who’s peeking, attackers get in.
