Absolutely Ali ‚Äî let‚Äôs break down **File Upload** completely. This is a common feature in web applications, but it‚Äôs also one of the most **exploitable attack surfaces** if not properly secured. I‚Äôll explain how it works, what can go wrong, and how to defend it.

## üß† What Is File Upload?

**File upload** allows users to send files (images, documents, videos, etc.) from their device to a server.

It‚Äôs used in:

* Profile picture uploads
* Document sharing
* Content management systems
* Cloud storage platforms

> While it seems simple, file upload opens the door to  **remote code execution** ,  **data leakage** , and **privilege escalation** if mishandled.

## üîç How File Upload Works

1. **Frontend Form**

```html
<form action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="file">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
```

2. **Backend Receives File**

* Parses the request
* Validates file type, size, and name
* Stores the file in a directory or database

3. **Optional Processing**

* Image resizing
* Virus scanning
* Metadata extraction

## üß® Common File Upload Vulnerabilities

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Unrestricted File Type**

* Server accepts `.php`, `.exe`, `.js`, etc.
* Attacker uploads a web shell or script

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **No File Size Limit**

* Attacker uploads massive files ‚Üí DoS (Denial of Service)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Path Traversal**

* Filename like `../../etc/passwd` ‚Üí overwrites system files

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **MIME Type Spoofing**

* File claims to be an image but is actually a script

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Stored XSS via SVG or HTML**

* Malicious content embedded in uploaded files

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Direct Access to Upload Directory**

* Files served from `/uploads/` without validation ‚Üí sensitive data exposure

---

## üß∞ Real-World Exploitation

* Uploading a `.php` file to a vulnerable server:

```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

* Accessing it via:

```
https://target.com/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```

‚úÖ Remote code execution achieved.

## üîê How to Secure File Uploads

### ‚úÖ 1. Whitelist File Types

* Only allow safe extensions: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.pdf`
* Validate MIME type and file signature (magic bytes)

### ‚úÖ 2. Rename Files on Upload

* Avoid using original filenames
* Use UUIDs or hashes

### ‚úÖ 3. Store Files Outside Web Root

* Prevent direct access via URL

### ‚úÖ 4. Scan Files for Malware

* Use antivirus or sandboxing tools

### ‚úÖ 5. Limit File Size and Quantity

* Prevent DoS and abuse

### ‚úÖ 6. Use Content-Disposition Headers

* Prevent inline execution of files

### ‚úÖ 7. Disable Script Execution in Upload Directory

* Configure server to treat uploads as static files

## ‚úÖ Final Summary

| Risk            | Description                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| RCE             | Uploading executable scripts |
| XSS             | Malicious content in files   |
| DoS             | Large or repeated uploads    |
| Data leak       | Access to sensitive files    |
| Privilege abuse | Overwriting system files     |

> File upload is powerful ‚Äî but without proper controls, it‚Äôs like letting strangers drop packages into your server‚Äôs living room.
